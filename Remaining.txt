Local model deployment

One approach to deploying a deep learning model for a tea plantation farm is to deploy the model locally on each farm. This approach has a number of advantages, including:

It is less latency-sensitive, since the model is running on the farm itself.
It is more secure, since the model data is not being transmitted over a network.
It is more scalable, since each farm can have its own model instance.
However, there are also some disadvantages to local model deployment, including:

It is more complex to manage, since each farm needs to have its own model instance.
It can be more expensive, since each farm needs to have its own computing resources.

Global model deployment

Another approach to deploying a deep learning model for a tea plantation farm is to deploy the model globally to a central server. This approach has a number of advantages, including:

It is less complex to manage, since there is only one model instance that needs to be managed.
It can be less expensive, since the computing resources can be shared by all of the farms.
However, there are also some disadvantages to global model deployment, including:

It is more latency-sensitive, since the model predictions need to be transmitted over a network.
It is less secure, since the model data is being transmitted over a network.
It is less scalable, since the central server may become overloaded if there are too many farms using the model.
Hybrid model deployment

A hybrid approach to deep learning deployment is to deploy the model both locally and globally. This approach combines the advantages of both local and global model deployment.

In a hybrid model deployment, the local model can be used to make predictions quickly and to provide a fallback option in case the global model is unavailable. The global model can be used to fine-tune the local models and to ensure that all of the farms are using the same model weights.
